Within the teams

Internally the tasks management is done using an instance of Redmine
hosted by Enthought for now. It goal is to allow management of all future Scipy
conferences. The project is called scipy-conf.
The current managers of the redmine instance include jrocher
[AT] enthought.com, bmurphy [AT] enthought.com, mtranby [AT]
enthought.com, and andy.terrel [AT] gmail.com.

Advertizing
========

Online websites that people read are best places to advertize for the conference:
* Slashdot
* Hacker News (don't think they do ads)
* Reddit.com (r/programming or r/python)
* Stacked Overflow (especially http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/ )
* Ars Technica
* Wired
* NA-digest (http://www.netlib.org/na-digest-html/)

You might also try to do organize join-advertizing with other related
conferences: 
* PyCon (in all its state and international flavors)
* PyData
* OSCON
* SuperComputing

Not very many developpers read journals or magazines, though
occasionaly people follow:
* Communications of the ACM
* SIAM News (http://www.siam.org/news/)
