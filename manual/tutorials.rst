Decision Points
===============

  * Are we doing tutorials shorter/longer than 4 hours. Last year's call says from 2hrs to 2 days. Should we just say 4hrs which has been the recent practice
  * Open/Assigned Seating - Should tutorials have assigned seating. Adv: Stops certain rooms from being overcrowded (i.e. IPython last year). Disadv: More of a registration/logistics hassle since you would have to keep track and enforce who was signed up for what
  * Introductory Tutorials - Invited? Fixed Topics? Open Topics?
 

Tracks
======

Introductory Track 
------------------

 This is one of the most important in terms of bringing new people into the Scipy community. In 2011, very few tutorial submissions fell into this category. We will need to encourage submissions and/or invite people to teach these topics. We may want to specify four 1/2 topics and invite proposals for those specific topics. 

 Suggested 1/2 day topics in order:

   * Introduction to NumPy with IPython and Matplotlib
   * Introduction to SciPy : optimization, linear algebra, statistics, and more
   * Intro to Pandas
   * Sympy?

Intermediate Track
------------------

Prerequisite should be basic understanding of Scipy stack, i.e. numpy, scipy, matplotlib etc. 

Advanced
--------

Under the hood or advanced concepts. 


Call for submissions
====================

Hello,

As you know, the SciPy Conference always kicks of with two days of Tutorials. These sessions provide extremely affordable access to expert training, and consistently receive fantastic feedback from participants. This year we are expanding the Tutorials to include an introductory, intermediate and advanced track.

*We are know accepting tutorial proposals from individuals or teams that would like to teach a tutorial at SciPy 2013.*

Whether you are a major contributor to a scientific Python library or an expert-level user, this is a great opportunity to share your knowledge and offset some of the costs of your SciPy 2013 attendance.

Topics
------

Tutorials should be focused on covering a well-defined topic in a hands-on manner. We want to see attendees coding! Each tutorial is assigned to either the Introductory, Intermediate or Advanced track, and are typically 4 hours in duration (OLD *may be given anywhere from two hours to two full days, depending on the breadth of the material*). For examples of content and format, you can refer to past tutorials such as the SciPy 2011 or 2012 tutorials. We are looking for awesome techniques or packages, helping new or advanced python programmers develop better or faster scientific applications. This year we trying something new. The topics for the introductory track are fixed and we invite you to pick one of the four topics listed below.

Stipend
-------

In recognition of the effort required to plan and prepare a high quality tutorial, we give at least a $750 stipend to each instructor (or team of instructors) for each half-day session they lead. This may stipend may increase to $1000 depending on availability of funds.

Proposal Submission
-------------------

Dharhas Pothina, scientist at the Texas Water Development Board, and Francesc Alted, scientist AT?, are the chairs for the SciPy 2013 Tutorials. To submit your tutorial proposal, please send the following materials to 2013Tutorials@scipy.org (?? Check Email):

  * A short bio of the presenter or team members, containing a description of past experiences as a trainer/teacher/speaker, and (ideally) links to videos of these experiences if available.
  * Which track the tutorial would fit best in â€” Introductory, Intermediate or Advanced.
  * A (~15 lines) description of the tutorial, suitable for posting on the SciPy website for attendees to view. It should include the target audience, the expected level of knowledge prior to the class, and the goals of the class. 
  * A more detailed outline of the tutorial content, including the duration of each part, and exercise sessions for the review process.
  * A list of Python packages that attendees will need to have installed prior to the class to follow along. Please mention if any packages are not cross platform. Installation instructions or links to installation documentation should be provided for packages that are not available through easy_install, pip, EPD, Anaconda CE etc., or that require third party libraries. 
  * If available, the tutorial notes, slides, exercise files, ipython notebooks, that you already have, even if they are preliminary.

Other Notes
===========

Need to write up more detailed instructions for the actual event. Points to remember:

  * Have folks submit test scripts that check whether you have all the packages required.
  * Encourage folks not to use development versions, have versions finalized before conference starts. This cause lots of issues last year.
  * No helping audience install stuff during tutorial. This caused lots of delays in some tutorials last year. Maybe have a pre-tutorial install time?
